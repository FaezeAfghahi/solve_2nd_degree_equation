solve a 2nd degree equation

A polynomial having degree 2 is considered a second-degree equation 
and it is also called a quadratic equation. 
The standard form of the second-degree equation is ax2+bx+c=0. 
Delta in the second-degree equation is used to find the type of roots that polynomial has.
If the Delta value for a polynomial is greater than zero (Delta>0) then the polynomial has
two real distinct roots. If the Delta value for a polynomial is equal to zero (Delta=0) 
then the polynomial has only one root. 
If the Delta value is less than zero (Delta<0) then the polynomial has two imaginary roots.

If the quadratic equation is of form ax2+bx+c=0
then the formula for finding the delta is given below-

Delta = b2-4ac
